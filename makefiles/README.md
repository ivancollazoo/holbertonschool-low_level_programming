Files
The following are very important steps
In the following tasks, we are going to use these files. We want to compile these only.
You can either create the files of the repository into your project folder (makefiles) and copy paste their content from github OR you can clone the 0x1B.c repository into the makefiles folder.
If youâ€™re going to clone it, you should enter the makefiles folder and inside this folder delete the .git folder using this command rm -rf .git then move the files from this folder into the makefiles folder to test your work.
